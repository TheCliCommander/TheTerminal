	<h1>Lets dive deeper into Linux commands!</h1>
	<h3>Lets talk about navigating the terminal first</h3>
	<p>We already talked about the main commands for navigating the terminal, but lets see what options those commands have and some useful tricks we can do with them</p>
	<p>Let's start with some useful 'shortcut' commands: understand that <strong>~</strong> or <strong>~/</strong> is a shortcut for your home directory. If you are deep in a subdirectory tree and need to return to your home folder you can use: <strong>cd ~/</strong> Just using the tilde will also work: <strong>cd ~</strong>
	<p>The <strong>cd</strong> command has a few options: you can use <strong>cd -</strong> to go to the last directory you were in, which is not the same as going to the parent dir with <bold>cd ..</bold> With this in mind we'll take this opportunity to discuss absolute and relative file paths. If you are in the dir that conatains the subdir you want to navigate to, you can use the relative path: <strong>cd nameOfDirectory</strong>. However if you need to navigate to something that is outside your current working directory, you must specify the full(absolute) path to the file/dir: <strong>cd ~/Linux/NetworkManager</strong></p>
