<h1>Networking With Linux Is Fun!</h1>
<br>
<em>I'm writing this guide assuming you have a basic understanding of networking in general. A basic understanding of the OSI model is suggested. Check out my page [placeholder] to learn the essentials.</em>

<h2>Discovering your private IP address:</h2>
<p>To discover your private IP address you can use the <code>ip</code> command. <em>Note: it may still be popular to use the <code>ifconfig</code> command but this is deprecated and should be replaced with the <code>ip</code> command.</em> You should understand that your machine has what is called a 'Network Interface Controller'. This device is what communicates with your LAN and the internet. It will have a name like <code>eth0</code> <em>or</em> <code>wlan0</code>(the latter of which is your wireless or 'WiFi' interface, while the former is your wired ethernet connection). These devices have two identifying addresses. One is a unique hardcoded address called a link layer or  media access control/MAC address. The other is called the Internet Protocol address, or IP address. We'll talk about the MAC address in another section.</p>
<br>
<p>To use the <code>ip</code> command to discover your current ipv4 address use the following syntax <code>ip -4 a</code>. For your ipv6 address: <code>ip -6 a</code>. To get both ipv4 and ipv6 just use <code>ip a</code>. Really simple right?</p>
